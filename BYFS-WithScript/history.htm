            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5px">Benson's DevOps Training started as an idea in the head of pioneer 
                Benson, who saw so many companies that had great ideas but struggled to get 
                them into the market and in the hands of customers. As Benson spoke with more people 
                about the issues they faced, it seemed as thoguh everything centered around 3 core
                areas: getting the idea to market, having the right messsages to describe it, and 
                foundational leadership to sustain momentum.</p>
            <br/>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5px"> Benson opened Benson's DevOPS Training in 2019 out of his bedroom, 
                With $700 and a single client. Today, Benson's DevOps training services over 100 clients across the United
                States and Europe, and employs more than 20 consultants and mentors. </p>
            <br/>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5px"> Benson's DevOps Training is located in sunny Grand Prairie, Texas,
                and is making plans for a London and Ghana office in the near future. Feel free to
